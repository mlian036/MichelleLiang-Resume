        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Michelle Liang, and I am a first year at the University of Riverside, California. I am a pre-business major, and I am excited to be able to focus mainly on my business studies. As a child growing up, I have always had an interest in business, and learning the backbone of our country. The economy is becoming different everyday, and I am interested in learning about all the changes of the stock market and learning about other business ventures. I plan to help my family in our own family business to be able to grow throughout the entire country to create in America, and chase the American Dream. My parents are immigrants that came from China and started from nothing. Our life since then has been crazy, and I travel all around the world with them by my side. They are my support system that always have my back, I could not do any of this without them.
<br><br>

        I am interested in pursuing business due to the way that I was raised, and this has shaped me into the person that I am today. My mom and dad have always taught me that if I ever set my mind to a goal, I can achieve it with hard work and consistency. Anything is possible, and I am determined to accomplish all my goals and continue to strive to do better. All of the experiences I have had growing up will help me put my knowledge for future work and internships. I have attended many business meetings and put my own input into many situations, so I am very familiar with this aspect of many negotiations. This has taught me to be able to handle any stress or pressure in any situation or problem that arises. I am so thankful for all of these learning experiences to continuously grow and improve as a person. I love being able to connect with people, and learn from my elders and mentors because their knowledge is like a gold mine. Without all of the love and support I have received, I would not be where I am to this day. 
<br><br>

        I grew up in a big family, and I have four other siblings that I am very close with. I am a middle child, and the eldest daughter in my family. I love going out with my friends, and exploring any city that we end up in. I believe that the best way to connect with someone is by having deep and uncomfortable talks sometimes, and really getting to know them. I enjoy the company of others, but I am also able to enjoy my own company. I am always the leader in group projects or when anything needs to be decided. I have no trouble making decisions and helping others when they are in need. Business will always be important in my life, and I will continue to push to help others in any way possible. I will continue to grow, and have my own journey of creating my own business.
